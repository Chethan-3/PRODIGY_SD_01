This Python program converts Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The user inputs a temperature and its unit, and the program converts it to the other two units using standard formulas. It then displays the results. If an invalid unit is entered, an error message appears. This tool is useful for students, scientists, and travelers. ðŸŒ¡
